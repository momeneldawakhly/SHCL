Security Headers Check List
| Header                           | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                     | Recommendation                                                                                                                             |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **X-Frame-Options**              | Prevents the browser from rendering a page in a `<frame>`, `<iframe>`, `<embed>`, or `<object>`. Useful for preventing clickjacking.                                                        | Prefer `Content-Security-Policy (CSP)` with the `frame-ancestors` directive, if supported. Otherwise, use `X-Frame-Options: DENY`.       |
| **X-XSS-Protection**             | Provides XSS protections in older browsers. However, it can introduce vulnerabilities and is superseded by CSP.                                                                             | Instead of relying on this, implement a strong `Content-Security-Policy (CSP)` and disable this header with `X-XSS-Protection: 0`.       |
| **X-Content-Type-Options**       | Prevents the browser from MIME-sniffing a response away from the declared Content-Type, reducing the risk of MIME confusion attacks.                                                         | Always include this header with the value `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` and set the `Content-Type` header properly.                    |
| **Referrer-Policy**              | Controls the amount of referrer data sent with requests.                                                                                                                                 | Use `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin` to enhance privacy and security.                                                    |
| **Content-Type**                 | Indicates the media type of the resource. Incorrectly setting this header can lead to security vulnerabilities like XSS.                                                                    | Set this header correctly, ensuring the MIME type matches the content being served and include the `charset` when necessary.               |
| **Set-Cookie**                   | Used to send cookies from the server to the client. Security attributes for cookies are crucial to prevent attacks like CSRF or session hijacking.                                           | Follow best practices for cookie security, including attributes such as `Secure`, `HttpOnly`, and `SameSite`.                              |
| **Strict-Transport-Security**    | Tells browsers to only access the site using HTTPS, preventing man-in-the-middle attacks.                                                                                                   | Use with `max-age` set to a long duration. Consider including `includeSubDomains` and `preload` if you understand the implications.        |
| ~~Expect-CT~~                    | (Deprecated) Allowed sites to opt-in to reporting and/or enforcement of Certificate Transparency requirements.                                                                              | Do not use this header. It is no longer necessary as major browsers now enforce CT compliance by default.                                  |
| **Content-Security-Policy**      | Protects against various injection attacks by defining a whitelist of trusted content sources.                                                                                               | Implement a strong `Content-Security-Policy (CSP)` that fits your application's needs, which can significantly reduce the risk of XSS.    |
| **Access-Control-Allow-Origin**  | Used in CORS to specify which domains are allowed to access resources. If not set, the browser's Same Origin Policy provides protection by default.                                          | Specify which origins may access resources. Avoid using `*` for sensitive resources and prefer to list specific, trusted domains.         |
| **Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy**   | Mitigates certain types of attacks like Spectre by creating a separate browsing context for a document.                                                                                      | Set as `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin` to isolate the browsing context to same-origin documents only.                            |
| **Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy** | Prevents a document from loading any cross-origin resources that do not explicitly grant permission to be loaded.                                                                            | Set as `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp`, which allows the document to only load resources with explicit permissions.          |
| **Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy** | Allows you to define a set of origins that are permitted to include a resource.                                                                                                              | Set as `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: same-site` to limit loading of resources to the same site or its subdomains.                         |
| **Permissions-Policy**           | Allows you to control which features are available to web pages based on their origin.                                                                                                       | Define a `Permissions-Policy` to disable unused browser features and prevent unwanted behavior in the case of content injections.          |
| **FLoC header**                  | Opt-out of Google's Federated Learning of Cohorts (FLoC) for interest-based advertising.                                                                                                     | Set as `Permissions-Policy: interest-cohort=()` to opt out of FLoC and protect users' privacy.                                             |
| ~~Server~~                       | Indicates the software used by the server, potentially revealing sensitive information to attackers.                                                                                         | Remove this header to avoid disclosing server information, or use non-informative values.                                                  |
| ~~X-Powered-By~~                 | Similar to the Server header, it reveals information about the technologies powering the server.                                                                                             | Remove this header to prevent information disclosure about server technologies being used.                                                 |
| ~~X-AspNet-Version~~             | Reveals the version of ASP.NET being used, used for .NET applications.                                                                                                                       | Disable this header to avoid exposing version details in your .NET applications.                                                           |
| ~~X-AspNetMvc-Version~~          | Reveals the version of ASP.NET MVC being used.                                                                                                                                               | Disable this header to avoid revealing MVC version information for .NET applications.                                                      |
| **X-DNS-Prefetch-Control**       | Controls whether the browser may use DNS prefetching to speed up page loads.                                                                                                                  | Use `X-DNS-Prefetch-Control: off` to disable DNS prefetching if you don't control all links and want to avoid potential privacy leaks.    |
| ~~Public-Key-Pins (HPKP)~~       | Associated a set of public keys with a web server to reduce the risk of MITM attacks using forged certificates.                                                                              | This header is deprecated due to the risk of pinning errors and is no longer recommended for use.                                          |
